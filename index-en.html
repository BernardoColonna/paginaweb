                <p>
                    Since the computer and the internet were invented in the 20th century, humanity is able to enjoy all the 
                    possibilities they brought it, either for scientific or personal purposes. In its early years, the computer 
                    was well known, and so is today, for its ability to manipulate big amounts of data faster than a person
                     could do by themself. That’s why its use became popular through the years, especially at universities 
                     and research centers.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s known that, during the 20th century, the world has passed through great pandemics. In 2020, 
                    that phenomenon is repeated as humanity is being challenged by the new Coronavirus/Covid-19 (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic,
                     which has been causing huge numbers of dead and sick people all over the world. Everyday, numbers have to 
                     be refreshed, so the governors are able to know what decisions to make based on the risk of each situation.
                      Statistical data may present mistakes when manually calculated, that’s why wealthy authorities, such as the
                       World Health Organization (WHO), have created, using the capacity of contemporary computation and internet 
                       connection, dashboards and graphics responsible for daily refreshing the numbers related to the pandemic.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As the virus presents a high capacity of being transmitted, knowing all its symptoms is important. The fever and cough caused by the new Coronavirus are sort of keys used by doctors to assume that a person is infected. In order to avoid transmissions, people with a high body temperature (above 37ºC or 98,6ºF) are oriented to look for medical care. But how can we measure people’s temperature massively and effectively, in the interest of identifying who is possibly sick? Some technologies have been invented to help humans deal with that dilemma, such as cameras capable of measuring anyone’s body temperature, via algorithms in a computer, and notify them about the possibility of being infected. That has been implemented in restaurants, places where the presence of different people is constant. The same technology has been applied to the use of facial masks, where people who don’t wear them are identified when looking at a screen.

                    Simultaneously, researchers from Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Instituto Butantan and Intel, have developed, in Brazil, a project called SoundCov. Based on the fact that there are different patterns of cough for each respiratory disease, commonly indistinguishable for humans ears, the project has been collecting audio recordings of coughs from different people, in favor of analysing them with an Artificial Intelligence technology to identify someone infected by Coronavirus by their cough.

                    Through what was exposed above, it’s noticeable that the use of computers makes communication between humans all around the world and the sharing of their information easier. In the specific case of the current pandemic, that importance is proved day by day, since technology is helping scientists from many countries who work tirelessly in their researches about the virus’ behaviour, besides the collecting and analysing of data. It reinforces the enormous contribution Computer Science has been offering humanity for almost a century.
